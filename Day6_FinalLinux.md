Topics

● Script Installation

● Errors on package managers

● Help on linux

● Linux Services

● alias

● tmux

● Wget

● find
## Script installation
Some hacking tools are developed by some peoples and those peoples make it 
open-source, that means we can get those scripts/programs from github


○ git clone <link_of_the_script_from_github>
## Script modules
● Scripts are made with scripting languages(programming) like
 { python,bash,go,ruby,...}
1. Python: to install python modules we use -> pip install <modulename>

    i. For requirements file -> pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Go: to install go modules -> go install <modulename>

3. Ruby: to install ruby modules -> gem install <modulename>
## Python installation
● If pip is not found there will be an error

● It will install 

● If the package is already installed: 
## If you need help on linux about commands
You can use
### man (manual) 

○ This will give you the whole 
manual and instruction of a 
tool or command.

■ man <yourcommand>
### Help 
○ Some Commands have help 
option.

■ <yourcommand> -h

■ <yourcommand> -help

■ <yourcommand> - -help
## Linux Processes & Services
● As we interact with Linux, we create numbered 
instances of running programs called 
“processes”

● To get the processes:

○ ps [options]

● More commands

○ ps -> for process running on my shell

○ ps -A -> view all running process

○ ps -u username -> view users process

● PID - Process ID
### To stop process
○ Kill [options] [PID]

● More on kill

○ kill -19 PID -> to stop the process

○ kill -18 PID -> to resume the process we stopped

○ kill -9 PID -> to Stop a process immediately

○ … there are 31 options.
## Foreground / backgroud
● Thus far, we have run commands at the prompt and waited for them to complete. We 
call this running in the “foreground.”

● Use the “&” operator, to run programs in the “background” or press ^Z

● To get the background process back to foreground"Fg"

To stop a process going inside your shell just press ^C 
## Null device
● /dev/null - Redirects output to nowhere.
● If you want to ignore output, you can send it to the null device, /dev/null. The null 
device is a special file that throws away whatever is fed to it. You may hear people refer 
to it as the bit bucket. If you do not want to see errors on your screen and you do not 
want to save them to a file, you can redirect them to /dev/null

● On shell output there are 2 things.

○ STDERR = 2

○ STDOUT = 1
● To redirect the errors from a command result we do 

○ command 2> filename => here if you check the file you saved on it have errors only

● To redirect the error-FREE output

○ command 1>filename

● So if we redirect our commands output to /dev/null we will get error free result

○ command 2> /dev/null
## alias

● Used to give a name to some bunch of 
commands.

● Example: if i wanted to name ls -la ‘rex so 
any time i want to get output of ls -la i just 
type rex

○ alias rex=’ls -la
## Tmux - Terminal Multiplexer
● Tmux is used to classify our terminal work.

● You can install it using apt. On kali it is built-in

● Then to start it just type ‘tmux’\

● To Create config file type

○ nano .tmux.conf

○ Type this

      ■ unbind C-b
      ■ unbind l
      ■ set -g prefix C-a
      ■ unbind %
      ■ bind e split-window -h
      ■ bind o split-window -v
      ■ set -g base-index 1
      ■ setw -g pane-base-index 1

○ Save it | exit tmux and open again
● To split horizontally 

○ ^A then o

● To split vertically 

○ ^A then e

● To exit 

○ ^A then x or 

○ just type ‘exit’

● To create tab 

○ ^A then c

● To rename the tab 

○ ^A then ,(comma)

● To switch tabs

○ ^A then <numbers>

○ TO switch partitions 

■ ^A then <arrow>

● … for more you can google but be aware of our super key is ^A
# Wget 
● Is a tool used to download files from websites/servers

● Syntax

○ wget [options] [link]

● wget https://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/intro-linux.pdf
# find
● ON terminal if you want to search for files/folders/musics/videos, we can use find 
command. 

● It is very essential tool

● Syntax:

○ find [search path] [options] [search word]

- More commands

- find / -name “linux”

- find /home -perm 777 

- find -type f | find -type d
