## What is Programming language
● It is language which helps to communicate with computers 
{they are not able to understand human languages}

● We humans have lots of 
languages(english,france,amharic,arabic..)

● Computers have this languages to

○ Assembly,C,C++,Java,Javascript,Python,Ruby,Perl,Go….

● Prog lang. Helps us to write programs using those languages
## What is Program?
● A program is an algorithm expressed in a programming 
language.

● An algorithm is a detailed sequence of actions to perform to 
accomplish some task.
## Types of Programming Languages

● Computers Understand binary(0/1) , humans 
don’t understand this

● SO based on the closeness of the language to 
humans we classify it into 3
 
● The more they become low to the machine they 
are faster.

● The more they become like human language they 
are slower.
### A) LOW level programming language
● These languages are more 
like machines but with lots 
of effort people can 
understand them. They 
are close to the hardware 
of the computer.

● Ex: Assembly
### B) High level Programming languages

● They are more close to 
human languages.

● Example: 
Python,C++,Java,JS…
### C) Medium Level
● Languages Between Low 
level and High level, they 
combine both

● Ex: C-lang
### How do high level languages work?
As we saw earlier we have said that computers know only binarys, and if we code 
with high level languages how do computers understand us?
1) Compilers: are tools which helps to convert the whole code to bytecode then 
computer will execute it

a) Example: C,C++,Java,..

2) Interpreter: can directly execute the code by reading the source code line by 
line

a) Example: python
## Uses of Programming language
● Android Application Development

● Website Development

● Machine learning

● Artificial Intelligence

● Game Development

● Big data Technology

● Desktop software development

● Hacking tool developmen
### What is Python Programming?
● Python is a High level & interpreted programming 
language. => Very easy to learn

● It is Very SImplified language any one can write with it, 
also can read it.
### Uses of Python
● Data visualization

● Data analysis

● Machine learning

● Artificial intelligence

● Back-end web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask)

● Game development

● Hacking Script writing
## IDE & Code editors
● IDE ( Integrated Development Enviroment ): Is a 
Software that helps to write & run a Specific Programming 
language. Example: PythonIDE

● Code Editors: are softwares those can help to write any 
kind of programming languages. And also by adding some 
compiling/ interpreting feature they can run 
programs/scripts Example: Sublime,Vscode
Outputs and COmments

● On python, to display output we use keyword ‘print’

● Syntax: print(object=’’, sep=’’, end=’’)
          \n - new line
          \t - tab space
print(text1,text2,text3…)
### Variables
● Variables are a value holders /containers/ 

● They store data

● We give some value to some word.

● example : number = 10 => from now on my python program knows the value of 
number is 10.

● The process of giving value to word is called Variable Declaration

● The word that holds the data is called Identifier

● We can Print value of variables by giving the identifier
### Data types
● Have you seen the data types we used on the variable slide?

● There are a lot of Data types on python
### A) Numeric Data type
● int(integer) - holds signed integers of non-limited length.

● float - holds floating decimal points and it's accurate up to 15 decimal places.

● complex - holds complex numbers.

####★ You can Identify The type of a variable with the keyword ‘type()   
###  B) String Data
● String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes. For 
example, var = “ ” or var = ‘   
### C) Sequence Data
#### 1) Lists

a) List is an ordered collection of similar or different types of items separated by 
commas and enclosed within brackets [ ]. For example, languages = 

["Swift", "Java", "Python"]

b) To access items from a list, we use the index number (0, 1, 2 ...). For 
example, languages[0]

c) We can add/modifie objects to the list, 
  
#### 2) Tuple

● Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is that tuples are 
immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified.

● we use the parentheses () to store items of a tuple. For example, product = ('Xbox', 499.99)

● Similar to lists, we use the index number to access tuple items in Python  
###  D) Dictionary data
● Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value 
pairs.

○ user1 = {'username':’nathan26,’password’:’p@$$word’}

■ username and password = key

■ nathan26 & p@$$word = value

● We use keys to retrieve the respective value. But not the other way around.
