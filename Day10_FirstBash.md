# Introduction to BASH scripting
## Topics 
● what is bash,

● use of bash for hackers

● Output

● variables & data type

● Input

● comment and indentations

● Arithmetic operation

● if-else
## What is Bash Script?
● Bash ( Bourne Again Shell)

● It is a shell, that used to interact with your 
kernel.

● What is Script?

○ Script is a file that contains shell 
commands.
The original is sh - Bourne shell
## Uses of bash
● Script development

● Simplifying tasks

● Simplifying your linux ability

● Developing hacking scripts.
## Starting with Bash
● Bash files can have “.sh” extention but you can have it with out .sh too

● The file have to have executable Permissions.

● You can use any text editors u need: VIM,nano,VScode,gedit,cherrytree…
## Displaying output
● To start Every bash scripts use shebang.
           #! /bin/bash
           #! /bin/sh
● To display outputs on bash you just do 

○ echo “YOUR TEXT HERE”

● To run your project you can do:
           /bin/bash hello.sh
          ./hello.sh -> need x
           hello -> need x
## Variables
● Bash Variables are same with python variables, with some exceptions.
● Syntax:
○ VARIABLE_NAME=value 

● Exceptions:
○ NO Space between the equal sign =

■ Never Start with Numbers

■ USE double quotes only.

● To use the variable we will use dollar sign( $ ) before the Variable name
● If you want to display the variable sticked with other text use ${VARIABLE_NAME}
● Bash Variables are string by default.
## System Variables 
● Are variables those are declared by the system.
● There are so many: LANG, TERM,MAIL,EDITOR,USER,SHELL….
● USER displays Computer owner(host)
## Variables & Data Types
● As we saw, the previous method they create strings only.
● So to create other data types we use declare.
● Arrays
a) Arrays are lists or tuples on python.
b) Syntax: 
            i) var=(“list1” “list2” “list3” “list4)
            ii) TO display echo 
            (1) ${var[0]}
             iii) To get all the elements 
            (1) ${var[@]}
             iv) To get the indexes 
            (1) ${!var[@]}
            v) To get the length 
            (1) ${#var[@]}
             vi) To add element to the array 
             1) var[4]=”list5”
             vii) To remove from the array 
              (1) unset var[3
## Bash Input
● On bash we have 2 methods to accept input

1. Read function

2. Arguments
### 1) Bash read 
● Read used to accept inputs while the script is running.

● Syntax: 
○ read -p “Text To Display” var

○ read -sp “Password: ” var => used to accept hidden texts like password.

○ read -a var => for accepting arrays
2) Arguments

● These helps to get input before the script starts
● Syntax:
○ Just use $0-$9 while you want to work with the input
## Comments
On bash the comments are start with #

For multi line comment we start with
<<COMMENTS

 body

COMMENTS , we close with this

## Bash sleep
● Sleep used to make a good waiting on our script.

● Syntax: 
○ sleep <number>s = sleep 3s
## Operation
● To do mathematical operations you have to do $(( expression ))

● we will use let keyword for assigning variable
1) Arithmetic Operations
          a) Addition $(( a + b ))
           b) Subtraction $(( a - b ))
            c) Multiplication $(( a * b ))
             d) Division $(( a / b ))
              e) Exponential $(( a ** b ))
               f) Modulo $(( a % b ))
2) Assignment Operations 
               a) Increment “let a+= 3”
               b) Decrement “ let a-= 3”
               c) Multiply “ let a*= 3 “
               d) Divide “ let a/=3 “
3) Comparison operation
Alphabetic comparison
- Greater Than => -gt
- Less Than => -lt
- Greater than and equals to => -ge
- Less than and equals too => -le
- Equal => -eq
- Not equal => -ne

Sign comparison
● >
● <
● >=
● <=
● =
● !=
 ## If else conditions
● Syntax: 

- If you used [ condition ] => 
you will use alphabetic 
comparison
- But for strings you can use 
sign too
If you used (( condition )) => you 
will use comparison
- On bash we don't have indentation but 
if u finished writing the body you type 
- “fi”
